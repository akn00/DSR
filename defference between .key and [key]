difference between object.key and object[key].

let's take an example of an object'result' in foreach loop.
here if we write :

result.key='value';

in here this is getting defined as a new variable 
and not updating the existing key.

so to sole solve this problem we should access the key by the
below syntax:

result[key]='value';

this will not create a new key named 'key'.
but will instead access the existing key on which we are iterarting 
and modify that.
